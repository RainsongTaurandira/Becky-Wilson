            <h3>Service Design</h3>
            <p>My service design career began in the Nova Scotia Government. Projects I work on range from complex public services to small internal applications. I am part of various multi-disciplinary teams working with departments to improve how they work.</p>
            <p>The current focus in my personal work is designing a collaborative habit application. This app will allow personal and collective habits with the ability to encourage other users, while keeping privacy as a priority. Following initial positive feedback on the concept, I began developing the paths, stories, and rules needed for development.</p>

            <h3>UI Design</h3>
            <p>Most of my user interface design has been for personal projects, such as the UI for indie game developers. My day job uses a design library with specific guidance for UI. Usability testing impacts how those elements are applied. Users look for consistency and simplicity in government websites, resulting in limited opportunity for creativity.</p>
            <p>For creative UI work and to break my own assumptions for UI, I work with indie developers on their UI and game design. This requires me to match the look, feel, and theme of the game while working inside game engine limitations. Projects that are constantly iterating are additionally challenging as nothing is ever "done". Sure, my day job work requires changes, but these tend to be relatively minor modifications, even once the project goes live. In game dev, more significant rework is unsurprising. This contrast improves my abilities and my flexibility.</p>

            <h3>Website Design</h3>
            <p>Simplifying website creation using templates is a familiar concept. Creatives often want a simple online presence that is not tied to an external entity. When your IP is your income, keeping control of that IP is critical. Full-design options are expensive and intimidating. Even the building block sites can be overwhelming and time consuming. My simplified website component system aims to solve these problems.</p>
            <p>These website components are designed for non-tech minded creators. A header style, footer style, and main page style are selected from prebuilt components. The text, font, colors, and images are submitted to me, and the draft site is created. After a review and editing phase, the site goes live using the creator's domain name. The simplicity of the process and design elements means less stress and cost. Creators create their own, simple site without spending time learning technical details. They can have their site and create their art too.</p>
